Safe Link Inspection

## 1️⃣ Hover Over Link
- Hover or long-press to see real URL.
- **Red flag:** Display text may look legitimate but actual URL differs.

## 2️⃣ Check Domain Carefully
- Look for typos: m1crosoft vs microsoft
- Extra words or wrong endings: .net, .org
- **Suspicious:** Not official Microsoft domain.

## 3️⃣ Use Online Link Scanners
- VirusTotal or URLVoid
- Paste URL to check for malware/phishing.

## 4️⃣ Avoid Logging in From Email Links
- Always visit official site manually: https://www.microsoft.com
- **Never enter credentials** via email link unless verified.

## 5️⃣ Check HTTPS & Certificate
- Even HTTPS can be fake.
- Look at certificate domain and issuer.
